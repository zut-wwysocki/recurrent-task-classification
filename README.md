# Automatic Classification of Recurring Tasks in Software Development Projects

This repository contains a (partial) replication package for the paper "Automatic Classification of Recurring Tasks in Software Development Projects" submitted to SEAA-KKIO 2024 conference. 

The replication package contains code of heuristic labeling algorithms, issue embeddings generator, and validation loop. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to publish the data due to confidentiality restrictions.

The structure of the package is as follows:
- Embedding - scripts for generating embeddings for task summaries and descriptions
- Classifier - scripts for training and evaluating classifiers + pre-trained classifiers to be used by others
- HeuristicClassify - scripts for labeling tasks based on keywords
"# recurrent-task-classification"
